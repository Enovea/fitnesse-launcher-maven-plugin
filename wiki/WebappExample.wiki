  # [http://code.google.com/p/fitnesse-launcher-maven-plugin/downloads/detail?name=fitnesse-launcher-webapp-example-1.2.0-src.zip Download the example webapp maven project]
  # Run `FitNesse` as a wiki server using:
{{{
mvn clean install -P wiki
}}}
  # Visit `http://localhost:9123/WebappExample` and explore!
  # Run `FitNesse` as automated integration tests using:
{{{
mvn clean install -P auto
}}}
  # The JUnit XML results can be found at target/fitnesse/results
  # The `FitNesse` HTML reports can be found at target/fitnesse/reports

----

  * If the automated tests are being run on a server without a display (for example, for continuous integration) then:
  # Make sure Firefox is installed
  # Run the tests using the "headless" profile:
{{{
mvn clean install -P auto -P headless
}}}
